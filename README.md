You can run the program by calling `main.py` using Python 3.7 or later.

You'll need several environment variables to get the application up and running correctly. 

* `AWS_REGION` : the region in which you want the application to run 
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key ID
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS access key secret

All of those values will be put in to the $HOME/.aws directory in the respective files so that all the AWS-client code in the application works correctly
